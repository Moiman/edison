Changes in 1.2.1
  * New sequence implementation based on Finger Trees
  * Add the 'Measured' class to the Data.Edison.Prelude

    create an EnumSet from a bit-encoded word
  * Additional minor changes to EnumSet

Changes in 1.2.0.1
  * Change use more efficent operations for StandardSet.{filterGT,filterLT}
    and StandardMap.{filterLE,filterGE,partitionLE_GT,partitionLT_GE}

Changes in 1.2 final

  * add Monoid instances for data structures


Changes in 1.2rc3
  * introduce the ambiguous/unambiguous concept and document
    all API operations

Changes in 1.2rc2
  * add strict variants of all folds and reduces
  * reverse argument orders to 'rcons' and 'lookup*' in
    Sequence
  * add symbolic operators for lcons, rcons, append, and lookup
    from the Sequence API
  * add symbolic operators for subsetEq, difference, intersection
    and union from the set API
  * rename 'single' to 'singleton' in all APIs
  * reaame 'intersect' to 'intersection' in Collection and
    Associated Collection APIs
  * add 'adjustOrInsert' to the Associated Collection API


Changes in 1.2rc1

    Collections and Associated Collections

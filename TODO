strictify folds for TernaryTrie
structuralInvariant for MyersStack
structuralInvariant for PatriciaLoMap
complete test coverage for Assoc
add docs to the implementations to help decide when to use which ones
put together some kind of benchmarking

check on FiniteMapX '*With' function docs -- copied from SetX and probably wrong
move adjustOrInsert :: (Maybe a -> a) -> k -> m a -> m a to
     adjustWithDefault :: a -> (a -> a) -> k -> m a -> m a ???
figure out adjustOrDelete(All)

make Sequence and AssocX functions which copy superclasses into alises
use 'assert' to check preconditions?

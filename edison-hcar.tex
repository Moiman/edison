Edison is a library of purely function data structures for Haskell
originally written by Chris Okasaki.  Conceptually, it consists of two
things:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A set of type classes defining data the following data structure
      abstractions: ``sequences'', ``collections'' and ``associative collections''
\item Multiple concrete implementations of each of the abstractions.
\end{enumerate}

The following major changes have been made since version 1.1:

\begin{itemize}
\item Typeclasses updated to use fundeps (by Andrew Bromage)
\item Implementation of ternary search tries (by Andrew Bromage)
\item Modules renamed to use the hierarchical module extension
\item Documentation haddockized
\item Source moved to a darcs repository
\item Build system cabalized
\item Unit tests integrated into a single driver program which exercises
      all the concrete implementations shipped with Edison
\item Multiple additions to the APIs (mostly the associated collection API)
\end{itemize}

Edison is currently in maintain-only mode. I don't have the time required
to enhance Edison in the ways I would like.  If you are interested in
working on Edison, don't hesitate to contact me.

The biggest thing that Edison needs is a benchmarking suite.  Although
Edison currently has an extensive unit test suite for testing correctness,
and many of the data structures have proven time bounds,
I have no way to evaluate or compare the quantitative
performance of data structure implementations in a
principled way.  Unfortunately, benchmarking data structures
in a non-strict language is difficult to do well.
If you have an interest or experience in this area, your help
would be very much appreciated.
